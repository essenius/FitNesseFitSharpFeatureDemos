Suites: variables, symbols
---

Use of variables can be tricky. Note how it is different when you use the ! before a table start row.

!define today {!today (yyyyMMdd)}

The variable value gets resolved in the symbol here

|script |Echo Fixture |
|$today=|echo|${today}|

But here the value does not get resolved.

!|script                      |
|$today2= |echo|${today}      |
|show     |echo|$today        |
|show     |echo|$today2       |
|check not|echo|$today|$today2|
