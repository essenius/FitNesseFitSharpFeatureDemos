Suites: decision table, scenario table
---
You can use scenarios in decision tables. Here is how.

Make sure you can refer to the relevant fixtures from the scenario

!|Library          |
|TemperatureFixture|

Create a scenario with a number of parameters, and if needed output parameters with a question mark.
Do the work that needs to be done, and assign any output parameters to symbols (without question mark).

|scenario|Convert|temperature        |in|scale|to|targetScale|expect|result?|
|$result=|convert|@temperature @scale|to|@targetScale                       |

Create a decision table with the name of the scenario, and provide the parameters as fields

!|Convert In To Expect                |
|temperature|scale|targetScale|result?|
|20         |C    |F          |68     |
|68         |F    |C          |20     |
|273.15     |K    |C          |0      |
|212        |F    |K          |373.15 |
