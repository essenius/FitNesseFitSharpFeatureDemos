The argument name matching can sometimes behave unexpectedly. With the matching, FitNesse stops after it finds a matching name, even if there is an argument that would match the complete name. So instead of taking the value of @param1, the value of @param is taken with the value '1' appended to it. The workaround is never to have a parameters with names where one contains the other. E.g. using @param1 and @param2 would not have caused issues.
