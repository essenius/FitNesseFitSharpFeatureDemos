Parameter names in scenarios should not start with the name of another parameter, or that other parameter value will get inserted instead.
The argument name matching can sometimes behave unexpectedly. With the matching, FitNesse stops after it finds a matching name, even if there
is an argument that would match the complete name. So instead of taking the value of @param1, the value of @param is taken with the value '1' appended to it. 
The workaround is never to have a parameters where one name starts with the name of another. E.g. using @param1 and @param2 would not have caused issues.
