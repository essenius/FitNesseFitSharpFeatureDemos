Showing an error in !-FitSharp-!: you can't use a symbol for the full fixture name. That resolves to a string instead of the fixture class.
It works fine if we use a partial name and hard-code the rest. Issue was reported: https://github.com/jediwhale/fitsharp/issues/116 
It was fixed in version 2.4. 

!|script|echo fixture|
|$TEST_SLIM=|echo|echo fixture|
|$EST_SLIM=|echo|cho fixture|

In !-FitSharp-! versions up to 2.3 this fails

!|script|$TEST_SLIM|
|ensure|echo |true|

And this succeeds

!|script|e$EST_SLIM|
|ensure|echo |true|

!|script|echo fixture|
|$QUERY=|echo|Query|

#a chained query table fixture.
!|Query:Test$QUERY|1|
|n|2n|
